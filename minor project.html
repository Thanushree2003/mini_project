        <h2>Red Fort</h2>
        <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qiːlaː]) is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India, that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.

            The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.</p>

            HAMPI
        </h2>
        <p>The modern-day city of Hoaspete boasts of housing the Hampi archaeological complex which is at a distance of 376 km from Karnataka’s present capital, in the Bellary district.

            Hampi sits across the mighty river Tungabhadra, a region once ruled by the glorious Vijayanagara emperors. The ancient Chalukyan rock-cut temples of Badami and Aihole are also not far away from the Hampi site.According to popular Hindu legends, Pampa or Parvati is the wife of Lord Shiva. She performed a rigourous penance atop the Hemakuta (literally, hill of gold) hills in Hampi, to bring Shiva, the loner acscetic, back to the householder’s life. The name ‘Pampa‘ transcended into Hampa and then Hampi, and thus the name of the ancient town.</p>

            QUTUB MINAR
        </h2>
        <p>The Qutub Minar, or Qutb Minar, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most iconic monuments in Delhi, India. The tower has five stories with intricate carvings and inscriptions from the Koran. It stands as an important symbol of Islamic rule in India throughout its history because it is a testament to the power and grandeur of Islamic architecture and a reminder of India's rich cultural heritage. The Qutub Minar is found in the Qutub Minar complex, along with Alauddin Khalji's mausoleum, the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, and the Iron Pillar.

            Qutbuddin Aibak, the first sultan of Delhi, started construction on Qutub Minar as a tower of victory after defeating the Hindu rulers. The minaret could also have been where the muezzin would call Muslims to prayer or a military watchtower to track enemy movement.        </p>

            BELURU
        </h2>
        <p>The Hoysala period of South Indian history began about 1000 CE and continued through 1346 CE. In this period, they built around 1,500 temples in 958 centres. Belur is called Beluhur, Velur or Velapura in old inscriptions and medieval era texts. It was the early capital of the Hoysala kings. The city was so esteemed by the Hoysalas that it is referred to as "earthly Vaikuntha" (Vishnu's abode) and "dakshina Varanasi" (southern holy city of Hindus) in later inscriptions.[8]

            One of the Hoyasala kings was Vishnuvardhana, who came to power in 1110 CE. He commissioned the Chennakeshava temple dedicated to Vishnu in 1117 CE, a temple considered as one of "five foundations" of his legacy.[7][9] According to Dhaky – a scholar of Indian temple architecture and temple history, this temple reflects the rising opulence, political power, deep spiritual dedication to Sri Vaishnavism of Ramanujacharya, and it is his magnum opus. The main temple is called Vijaya-Narayana and the smaller temple next to it built by his queen Santala Devi is called Chennakesava in the inscriptions of his era, but these two temples are now called the Chennakesava temple and Chennigaraya temple respectively.[10] </p>

            GOLDEN TEMPLE
        </h2>
        <p>The Golden Temple (also known as the Harimandir Sahib (lit. 'abode of God', Punjabi pronunciation: [ɦəɾᵊmən̪d̪əɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ]), or the Darbār Sahib, 'exalted court', [d̪əɾᵊbaːɾᵊ saːɦ(ɪ)bᵊ] or Suvaran Mandir[2]) is a gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.[3][4] It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism. It is one of the holiest sites in Sikhism, alongside the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in Kartarpur, and Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib.[3][5]

            The man-made pool on the site of the temple was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in 1577.[6][7] In 1604, Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib and is the prominent figure in the development of gurudwara who built it in the 16th Century.[3][8] The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan armies.[3][5][9] Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830.</p>

       <p>Jallianwala Bagh or the garden of the Jallah-man, with its well, implies that it was once green and flowering.[1] Over the years it had become popular as a recreation ground and an area of rest for those visiting the nearby Golden temple.[1] In 1919, it was a dried-out plot, surrounded by tightly packed multi-occupancy buildings dividend by some narrow streets, and having only one entrance and exit route.[2] It was unoccupied and surrounded by a wall.[2] The place derives its name from the Pandit Jalla.[3]In 1919, in response to excluding Mahatma Gandhi from visiting Punjab, the secret deportation of Saifuddin Kitchlew and Satyapal on 10 April and the reactions to the Rowlatt Act, Punjab had witnessed attempts of Indians to gather and protest.[1] On the morning of Baisakhi, 13 April 1919, to the sound of military drums by the cities town criers, 19 locations around the city were read out Brigadier General R.E.H. Dyer's new rules.</p>

           HAWA MAHAL
       </h2>
       <p>The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India. Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers.

        The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan.[1] He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace.
        
        It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework.[2] The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.[2][3][4] Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back.[5]</p>
